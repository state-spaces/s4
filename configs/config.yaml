# @package _global_
defaults:
  - _self_
  - experiment: base # Specifies model and pipeline, equivalent to next two lines
  # - model: s4 # Model backbone
  # - pipeline: cifar # Specifies collection of configs, equivalent to next 5 lines
  # Pipelines should specify /loader, /dataset, /task, /encoder, /decoder (ideally in that order)
  # # - loader: default # Dataloader (e.g. handles batches)
  # # - dataset: cifar # Defines the data (x and y pairs)
  # # - task: multiclass_classification # Defines loss and metrics
  # # - encoder: null # Interface between data and model
  # # - decoder: null # Interface between model and targets
  - callbacks: # Extra pytorch-lightning features
    - base
    - checkpoint
    - rich # RichProgressBar and RichModelSummary

# Additional arguments used to configure the training loop
# Most of these set combinations of options in the PL trainer, add callbacks, or add features to the optimizer
train:
  seed: 0
  name: null # optional name for the run to make logging easier
  # These three options are used by callbacks (checkpoint, monitor) and scheduler
  # Most of them are task dependent and are set by the pipeline
  interval: ??? # Should be specified by scheduler. Also used by LR monitor
  monitor: ??? # Should be specified by pipeline. Used by scheduler (plateau) and checkpointer
  mode: ??? # Should be specified by pipeline. Used by scheduler (plateau) and checkpointer
  ema: 0.0 # Moving average model for validation # TODO move into callback
  test: False # Test after training
  debug: False # Special settings to make debugging more convenient
  ignore_warnings: False # Disable python warnings

  # These control state passing between batches

    mode: null # [ None | 'none' | 'reset' | 'bptt' | 'tbptt' ]
    n_context: 0 # How many steps to use as memory context. Must be >= 0 or None (null), meaning infinite context
    n_context_eval: ${.n_context} # Context at evaluation time
  # Convenience keys to allow grouping runs

  ckpt: null # Resume training

  disable_dataset: False # Disable dataset loading
  validate_at_start: false

  pretrained_model_path: null # Path to pretrained model
  pretrained_model_strict_load: true # Whether to load the pretrained model even if the model is not compatible

# We primarily use wandb so this is moved to top level in the config for convenience
# Set `~wandb` or `wandb=null` or `wandb.mode=disabled` to disable logging
